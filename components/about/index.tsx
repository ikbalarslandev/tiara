            Hello, I&apos;m Tiara, a passionate pet sitter with a love for
            animals and a global perspective on pet care. With experience pet
            sitting in Turkey, Indonesia, and the UAE, I bring a diverse
            background and a deep understanding of different pet needs to my
            services. My goal is to combine my love for animals with my desire
            to travel, offering reliable and attentive care for your pets
            wherever I go. I proudly own a cat named Tobey, whom I adopted from
            an animal shelter in Istanbul, Turkey. This experience has
            strengthened my commitment to compassionate pet care. Whether
            you&apos;re traveling or need support with your pet, I&apos;m
            dedicated to providing a safe and nurturing environment tailored to
            your pet&apos;s needs.
